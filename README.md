Image Processing and Computer Vision Course Assignment 1
**Written in Python on PyCharm workspace** ![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73976733/104122372-55ae3700-534d-11eb-8de4-492973fca972.jpeg)
                                               
In this assignment the following tasks were implemented using Python and the OpenCV library:

**Reading an image into a given representation** -> Reads an image, and returns the image converted as requested

**Displaying an image** -> Reads an image as RGB or GRAY_SCALE and displays it

**Transforming an RGB image to YIQ color space**-> Converts an RGB image to YIQ color space

**Transforming an YIQ image to RGB color space**->Converts an YIQ image to RGB color space

**Histogram equalization**->Equalizes the histogram of an image

**Optimal image quantization**-> Quantized an image in to **nQuant** colors

**Gamma Correction**->GUI for gamma correction with trackBar from(• OpenCV trackbar example and • Gamma Correction Wikipedia)
